## How to use

- use your actual API key in the query
- do as chrome docs say to use unpacked plugin
- click button, or use Cmd+Shift+V to get answer

## Stuff to improve

- Switch to manifest v3
- Use better query selectors (the current ones often fail to work properly, or target the wrong content)
- Put the API key in a .env
- Cleanup the code a little (I dirty copied the hello world and modified stuff quickly)
- Make it work for other exercises than simple text (adding the corresponding CTAs to the popup and html)
